9. On Halloween $31$ children walked into the principal's office asking for candy. They can be classified into three types: Some always lie; some always tell the truth; and some alternately lie and tell the truth. The alternaters arbitrarily choose their first response, either a lie or the truth, but each subsequent statement has the opposite truth value from its predecessor. The principal asked everyone the same three questions in this order. "Are you a truth-teller?" The principal gave a piece of candy to each of the $22$ children who answered yes. "Are you an alternater?" The principal gave a piece of candy to each of the $15$ children who answered yes. "Are you a liar?" The principal gave a piece of candy to each of the $9$ children who answered yes. How many pieces of candy in all did the principal give to the children who always tell the truth?

19. Suppose that $13$ cards numbered $1, 2, 3, \ldots, 13$ are arranged in a row. The task is to pick them up in numerically increasing order, working repeatedly from left to right. In the example below, cards $1, 2, 3$ are picked up on the first pass, $4$ and $5$ on the second pass, $6$ on the third pass, $7, 8, 9, 10$ on the fourth pass, and $11, 12, 13$ on the fifth pass.
